Farmers should analyze predicted market prices before harvesting and selling crops.

High disease severity reduces yield significantly and affects final revenue.

Excess rainfall increases fungal disease risk, especially in tomatoes and rice.

Low rainfall reduces yield but can improve storage quality in certain crops.

Harvest timing impacts price. Selling during peak supply lowers profit.

If predicted market price is high, selling within 3-5 days is recommended.

If predicted market price is low, holding the stock may improve revenue.

Fertilizer usage directly impacts yield. Overuse can damage soil quality.

Soil quality above 7 (on a 1-10 scale) significantly improves productivity.

Cold storage can increase selling flexibility if prices are temporarily low.
