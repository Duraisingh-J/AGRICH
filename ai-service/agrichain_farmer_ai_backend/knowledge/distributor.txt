Distributors should optimize routes to reduce fuel consumption and delivery time.

Cold-chain temperature must remain stable to prevent spoilage.

Temperature deviation above safe threshold increases spoilage probability.

Faster delivery reduces quality degradation for perishable crops.

Vehicle capacity should match load size to reduce logistics cost.

Spoilage risk increases when transport time exceeds recommended limits.

Warehouse humidity control prevents fungal growth.

Real-time tracking improves transparency and trust in the supply chain.

Shorter routes reduce carbon footprint and operational cost.
